# Object Detection Android Application

This Android application is designed to detect objects using a TensorFlow Lite model. It utilizes the TensorFlow Lite framework to perform real-time object detection on images captured by the device's camera.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using a TensorFlow Lite model.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Ability to capture images and detect objects within them.
- Efficient use of device resources for fast processing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the application on your Android device or emulator.

Usage
1. Launch the application on your Android device.

2. Grant necessary permissions for the application to access the device camera.

3. Point the camera towards objects you want to detect.

4. Tap the capture button to capture an image and perform object detection.

5. View the detected objects on the screen along with their confidence scores.

Model
The object detection model used in this application is a TensorFlow Lite model trained on a specific dataset. The model file (.tflite) can be found in the assets directory of the project.
